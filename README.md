## Description

A simple task tracker used to keep track of when something is due using color indication if it is close to or past the due date.

## Usage

When clicking the add task button on the homepage a modal window is displayed asking for a title, description, and due date. When you click the add task button in the modal window a drag and droppable card is created on the page that you can move into different states of completion.
